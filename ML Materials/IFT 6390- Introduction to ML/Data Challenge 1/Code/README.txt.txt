Prerequite:
1.  Make sure the dataset are linked under the following directory,
/kaggle/input/ift3395-6390-arxiv/...
2.Version of the should be Python 3.6 or greater

Step 1: run the python file "nb_scratch.py"

Step 2: A new file will be generated called "submission.csv" (model prediction after training and validation)

Step 3: Upload the "submission.csv" under Submit Prediction in Kaggle to get the accuracy score to estimate the model generalized performance
